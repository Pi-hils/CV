<p>I am an ambitious, creative and self-motivated <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> who enjoys solving complex problems and helping my team to succeed. As I take genuine pleasure in dissecting concepts to examine what works best and why it works or does nnot work, I decided to study at on eof Europe's leading coding bootcamp, Makers Academy. 

I am naturally inquisitive and methodical in my thinking, always aiming to break down problems into small achievable actions. I am looking for opportunities where I can continue to learn, whilst solving real-world problems with a team of ambitious people.</p>

## Skills

<h4><strong>Fast Learner | Adaptability</strong></h4>
At Makers, we were continually pushed to stretch ourselves and develop our skills on a daily basis. With the concepts and topics used in learning Ruby, I was quickly able to pick up Ruby on Rails in just a week during a 2 weeks project to recreate Acebook. Javascript ES6 and the ES5 was no different when it was introduced in weeks 5 & 7. For our final group project, we took advantage of the opportunity we had and decided to learn the language in depth and hence used some JavaScript libraries including jQuery and Ajax to complete the project. Having no prior knnowledge or background in any of these technologies, it was a testament to how fast I can adapt and learn new technologies in a collaborative environment.
<br>

<br>
<h4><strong>Teamwork | Leadership | Communication </strong></h4>
 Workinng within a global organisation was the breading space for working collaboratively within teams. Working in a global Fintech company enhanced my ability to work collaboratively, to adapt swift to my environment as well as develop my leadership skills. Within 2 months of joining the organisationn, I was took the responsibity of owning an entire Escrow Account process. This meant that I was dealing with both our clients in Ireland and customers from across the globe who needed a visa to enter into Ireland for education. As the clients increased in nnumber, I created a training and frequent virtual meetings with colleagues in Singapore, Spain and America to keep them all to speed as to how to approach issues that may arise. I collaborated with our product managers to create an updated tool to enhace the process of the task.
