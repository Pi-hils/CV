<p>I am an ambitious, creative and self-motivated <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> who enjoys solving complex problems and helping my team to succeed. As I take genuine pleasure in dissecting concepts to examine what works best and why it works or does nnot work, I decided to study at on eof Europe's leading coding bootcamp, Makers Academy. 

I am looking for opportunities where I can continue to learn, whilst solving real-world problems with a team of ambitious people.</p>

## Skills

<h4><strong>Fast Learner | Adaptability</strong></h4>
At Makers, we were continually pushed to stretch ourselves and develop our skills daily. With the concepts and topics used in learning Ruby, I was able to quickly pick up Ruby on Rails during a 2 weeks project to recreate Acebook. Javascript ES6 and the ES5 was no different when it was introduced in weeks 5 & 7. For our final group project, we took advantage of the opportunity we had and decided to learn the language in depth and hence used some JavaScript libraries including jQuery and Ajax to complete the project. Having no prior knnowledge or background in any of these technologies, it was a testament to how fast I can adapt and learn new technologies in a collaborative environment.
<br>

<br>
<h4><strong>Teamwork | Leadership | Communication </strong></h4>
 Working within a global Fintech company created countless opportunities to work collaboratively, adapt swiftly to any environment, as well as develop my leadership skills. Within 2 months of joining the organisationn, I took the responsibility of owning an entire Escrow Account process. This meant that I was dealing with both our clients in Ireland and customers from across the globe who needed enter into Ireland for education. As the clients increased in nnumber, I offered training and frequent virtual meetings with colleagues in Singapore, Spain and America as well as other departments such as the Operations team and our software engineers to keep them all updated and anticipate issues that may occur. I collaborated with our product managers to offer feedback and create tools to improve the processes. Coming from a sporting background to a Fintech and taking responsibility of an entire process within that short period of time is evidence that I enjoy adapting and thriving in a collaborative and ambitious space.
